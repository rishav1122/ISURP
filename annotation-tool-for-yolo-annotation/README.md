# Annotation tool for YOLO
Instructions -

For python3 users in main.py replace the 10th and 11th line with-

"import tkinter

from tkinter import *

import tkinter.messagebox"

Place the images which are to be labelled in "Images/001/" folder.

Please do not change the names of the folder, the variables in the code are adjusted accordingly.

First run the main.py file. A new window would appear which will ask for the Image directory enter 001 for that, then start your work.

Please mark the boxes precisely so that no extra part (the grass) should come in the box, 3 examples are shown in the Examples/001  directory.

Like try to minimize the irrelevant part. 

You just need to bound the red part which is 25cm x 25cm and not the whole 1m x 1m sqaure. 

After you are done with all images, then finally run convert.py

And upload the txt files in Lables/001s not Lables/001.
