"import tkinter

from tkinter import *

import tkinter.messagebox"

Place the images which are to be labelled in "Images/001/" folder.

# Extra notes
Please do not change the names of the folder, the variables in the code are adjusted accordingly.


Please mark the boxes precisely so that no extra part (the grass) should come in the box, 3 examples are shown in the Examples/001  directory.

Like try to minimize the irrelevant part. 

And upload the txt files in Lables/001s not Lables/001.
